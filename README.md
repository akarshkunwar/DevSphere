# DevSphere
A personal project for practice of DevOps tools and cloud computing implementation.
The idea was to implement all the tools I have learnt in my 5th semester of engineering, but was blown a bit out of proportion as it gained traction and I kept getting new ideas. 
The initial goal was to create a simple blogging platform for people new to DevOps engineering, seeking guidance from those more experienced, sort of like a StackOverflow 
but tailored for devops.
Feel free to experiment with the repo, I intend on giving it a public license later anyway.
